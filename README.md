# Movie-Watchlist

## Description
-I created this to practice creating multiple page websites and giving the user the ability to make a get request to the API to return movies  
-It also allowed me to practice saving information on local storage and using it on another page of the website   

## Required
-Code editor (Visual Studio Code recommended)  

## Installation
-Download the files from Github  
-Open them in a code editor of your choice (or with a text editor like notepad)    
-Preview them like you normally would (if using visual studio code use an extension like live server)    

## Usage/Features
-You can search for a title of a movie and it returns all options  
-You can then save it to your watchlist or remove it
